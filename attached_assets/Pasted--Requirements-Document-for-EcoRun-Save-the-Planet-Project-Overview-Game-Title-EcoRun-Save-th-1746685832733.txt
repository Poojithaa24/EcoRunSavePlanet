🌍 Requirements Document for EcoRun: Save the Planet
📝 Project Overview
Game Title: EcoRun: Save the Planet
Genre: Endless Runner / Environmental Strategy Hybrid
Target Audience: Casual gamers, students, eco-conscious individuals (ages 8+)
Platform: Web (preferred for hackathon), or Android/PC

🎯 Objective
Create a fun and educational endless runner game that raises awareness about environmental issues. Players collect trash, plant trees, and build eco-villages while avoiding pollutants and hazards. The goal is to survive, clean up as much as possible, and educate players through gameplay.

Eco-Upgrades	Collected items can be exchanged for eco-upgrades like tree planting, solar panels, recycling centers.
Environmental Hazards	Avoid smoke, oil spills, and industrial zones that reduce eco-score or slow down the player.
Eco-Meter	A progress bar showing how green the planet is based on the player’s performance.
Real-world API Integration (Optional)	Use APIs (e.g., OpenWeatherMap, pollution data) to change levels dynamically based on the real environment.
Leaderboard (Optional)	Tracks eco-scores to encourage competition and replayability.
Educational Pop-ups	Quick facts or tips about sustainability shown when certain milestones are reached.
